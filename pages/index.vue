        <div>
          <p>
            Because this pool is run by professionals who have been involved in
            the Cardano ecosystem since 2017. We provide world-class technical
            infrastructure with ultra-safe protocols. Proudly part of the Single
            Pool Operator (SPO) group, we’re only focussed on this single stake
            pool, keeping the network as decentralised as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’re in this for the long haul, having just secured a 3 year lease
            on our cloud based infrastructure. So you can safely collect your
            rewards with us, for the long term.

            <div>
              Sandstone servers are cloud hosted for maximum security. Our
              system is designed with built-in backups (redundancy). So we will
              never be offline. Which means you’ll always be collecting rewards,
              we mint blocks in
              <strong>every epoch</strong>.

            <div>
              As a long-standing member of the Cardano community, we contributed
              to the Incentivised Tesnet (ITN) phase with additional software
              that became known as the ‘<em>Stable-Alpha</em>’ builds. We also
              assisted great projects like
              <a
                  href="https://github.com/AndrewWestberg/cncli"

              We pride ourselves on running a highly rewarding pool dedicated to
              supporting the decentralisation of Cardano. We’ve maintained a
              very high pledge as proof of our long term investment in our pool
              and the community.

            <h3>Fees</h3>
            <div>
              To support the community, we keep our fees very low at Sandstone,
              less than 2% in fact. This ensures 98% of all staking rewards go
              to you, the delegator.

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="grid gap-6 md:col-span-2">
          <expandable title="Is staking safe?">
            <p>
              Yes. Staking on your $ADA tokens on is very safe. Cardano is one of
              the few Proof of Stake blockchains that allows you to keep your
              coins in your wallet when you stake. They’re yours and you can
              access them whenever you need to. There is no lock up period when
              you stake on the network.
            </p>
          </expandable>
          <expandable title="When will I see my rewards?">
            <p>
              Time on the Cardano blockchain is measured in epochs (120hrs or 5
              days). While there is no lock up period for staking, you won’t see
              your first rewards for 5 epochs. This is because rewards are
              calculated retrospectively about 2 epoch in the past.
            </p>
          </expandable>
          <expandable title="Do I need to claim rewards each time they're awarded?">
            <p>
              No, your rewards are compounded automatically in your total
              delegation, and included in the calculation of future rewards. The
              only time you need to claim your rewards is to bring them back on to
              your wallet. We recommend doing this roughly every quarter.
            </p>
          </expandable>
          <expandable title="What should I look for when choosing a stake pool to delegate to?">
            <p>
              Cardano strives to be the most decentralised blockchain out there, so
              choosing a Single Pool Operator (SPO) will contribute to that aim.
              Consider SPOs that are active in the Cardano community, minting blocks
              every epoch and have several ways to communicate with, so you can
              reach them if you have any questions.
            </p>
          </expandable>
          <expandable title="Are single pool better than larger operators (e.g. Binance, Kraken, Atomic, etc)?">
            <p>
              Yes they are. Single Pool Operators (SPO) are focussed on one single
              pool, and contribute directly to the decentralisation of the Cardano
              network. They also tend to work harder for their pools. Larger pool
              operators run like factories and trim costs to maximize profits.
            </p>
          </expandable>
          <expandable title="How are blocks allocated to stake pools per epoch?">
            <p>
              Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Tempora unde
              alias sapiente iste voluptate dolore error odit suscipit similique
              illo necessitatibus amet, reprehenderit nihil accusamus sed
              perferendis quibusdam! Iste, quae!
            </p>
          </expandable>
          <expandable title="Do you take your 2% fee from the interest rate?">
            <p>
              NO. The pool’s reward rate – the % interest you earn - is calculated
              on the total rewards paid out. The two 2% fee is taken from the
              rewards, not the percentage profits. Meaning 98% of all tokens paid
              out go to you, the delegators.
            </p>
          </expandable>
          <expandable title="Do I need to stake each time I add coins to my wallet?">
            <p>
              NO. Once you’ve linked your wallet to a stake pool the balance is
              automatically adjusted when you add or remove tokens from that wallet.
            </p>
          </expandable>
          <expandable title="My exchange offers staking, should I just do that?">
            <p>
              We don’t think so. Exchanges can keep up to 20% of staking rewards.
              Also contributing your delegation to the very large pool operators
              gives them more power in swaying the direction of the Cardano
              ecosystem. SPOs lead to greater decentralisation.
            </p>
          </expandable>
          <expandable title="How do I unstake?">
            <p>
              To unstake from a pool, simply choose another pool to delegate to.
            </p>
