Every blockchain has a whitepaper. Cardano has a cast of characters.

If you have spent any time in the Cardano ecosystem, you know it is not just a blockchain — it is a sprawling, occasionally chaotic, deeply passionate community of researchers, builders, educators, governance nerds, meme lords, and the occasional person in a full-body dog costume. And honestly? That is part of the charm.

While other chains might rally around a single figurehead or a VC-funded hype machine, Cardano's story has always been an ensemble production. Think of it less like a Silicon Valley startup pitch and more like the credits of a film that somehow involves peer-reviewed cryptography, Ethiopian school children, and a quadrillion-supply meme token named after the founder.

So grab a coffee (or something stronger — you will need it for 50 of these). Here is our who's who of the Cardano ecosystem, ranked roughly by prominence and impact. It is not exhaustive — thousands of people make this ecosystem tick — but it is a tour through the personalities that make Cardano unlike anything else in crypto.

---

## 1. Charles Hoskinson — The Protagonist

**Role**: Founder & CEO, [Input Output Global (IOG)](https://iog.io/) | **X**: [@IOHK_Charles](https://x.com/IOHK_Charles) | **GitHub**: [input-output-hk](https://github.com/input-output-hk)

Every great story needs a lead, and love him or loathe him, Charles Hoskinson is Cardano's. The Hawaiian-born mathematician co-founded Ethereum (as its first CEO, no less) before departing in 2014 over what boiled down to a fundamental disagreement about whether the project should chase venture capital or stay nonprofit. He chose door number three: start over and do it with peer-reviewed research.

Together with Jeremy Wood, Hoskinson founded IOHK (now IOG) and launched Cardano in 2017 — the first blockchain built on a formally verified proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Under his watch, IOG has published over 190 academic papers and partnered with the University of Edinburgh and Tokyo Institute of Technology. In 2021, he [donated $20 million to Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/math/news-events/hoskinson-center.html) to establish the Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics, because apparently building one revolutionary project was not enough.

He is also Cardano's most polarising figure by a wide margin. His YouTube AMAs are legendary — part technical briefing, part ranch tour, part philosophical monologue about the future of humanity. He has tangled publicly with governance critics, faced [allegations about unclaimed ADA](https://adapulse.io/a-history-of-cardanos-dramas-and-controversies/) from the Allegra hard fork (which he denied and countered with plans for an independent audit), and has a social media presence that could generously be described as "prolific." Whether you see him as a visionary or a lightning rod largely depends on which day you check X.

## 2. Aggelos Kiayias — The Architect

**Role**: Chief Scientist, [IOG](https://iog.io/) / Chair in Cyber Security & Privacy, [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) | **Google Scholar**: [Aggelos Kiayias](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P_L_vZAAAAAJ)

If Hoskinson is the face of Cardano, Professor Aggelos Kiayias is the brain. The Greek cryptographer designed Ouroboros — the proof-of-stake consensus protocol that underpins the entire network — and has served as IOG's Chief Scientist since 2016. His day job (yes, he has a day job on top of all this) is holding the Chair in Cyber Security and Privacy at the University of Edinburgh, where he directs the Blockchain Technology Laboratory.

Kiayias collects academic honours the way some people collect NFTs. In 2025, he was named a [Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery](https://awards.acm.org/fellows) — one of the highest accolades in computer science. That came after the [2024 BCS Lovelace Medal](https://www.bcs.org/articles-opinion-and-research/lovelace-medal-2024/) and election to the [Royal Society of Edinburgh](https://rse.org.uk/). His work gives Cardano something almost no other blockchain can claim: a consensus mechanism with actual mathematical security proofs. Not "trust us, it works" — but "here is the formal proof, peer-reviewed and published."

## 3. Frederik Gregaard — The Diplomat

**Role**: CEO, [Cardano Foundation](https://cardanofoundation.org/) | **X**: [@F_Gregaard](https://x.com/F_Gregaard) | **LinkedIn**: [gregaard](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/gregaard)

Picture someone who spent two decades navigating PwC and Swiss finance, then decided blockchain governance sounded like a fun next chapter. That is Frederik Gregaard. The Danish-born, Zürich-based executive became the Cardano Foundation's first CEO in September 2020, and has spent the years since trying to steer what is essentially a decentralised diplomatic mission across three pillars: operational resilience, education, and adoption.

It has not all been smooth sailing. In late 2024, [anonymous whistleblower allegations](https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-hoskinson-whistleblower-allegations/) accused the Foundation of internal power plays and insufficient participation in decentralised governance. Early 2025 brought public tensions over the [Intersect budget](https://www.intersectmbo.org/), with the Foundation pushing for significant cuts to IOG's allocation. Gregaard has navigated these storms with the kind of measured composure you would expect from someone who has survived Swiss boardrooms. Whether you see the Foundation as a steadying hand or an overly cautious gatekeeper tends to depend on which side of the budget debate you are standing.

## 4. Ken Kodama — The Businessman

**Role**: Founder & Chairman, [EMURGO](https://emurgo.io/) | **LinkedIn**: [ken-kodama](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-kodama-088a59101/)

Ken Kodama is the co-founder of Cardano you have probably heard the least about — and that is by design. While Hoskinson took the stage and IOG published the papers, Kodama quietly built EMURGO from scratch as Cardano's commercial arm. A Japanese-based businessman with a background in financial planning and consulting, Kodama established EMURGO in 2017 and grew it into a global organisation spanning Singapore, Japan, the USA, India, and Indonesia.

In April 2025, after completing EMURGO's original five-milestone roadmap, Kodama [stepped from CEO to Chairman](https://emurgo.io/), passing the baton to Phillip Pon. His legacy is the thing Cardano needed most alongside its academic credentials: a serious commercial engine. If Hoskinson is the "why" and Kiayias is the "how," Kodama has always been the "who is going to pay for this."

## 5. Jeremy Wood — The Quiet Co-Founder

**Role**: Co-founder & former Chief Strategy Officer, IOG

Jeremy Wood might be the most important person in Cardano that almost nobody talks about. A graduate of Indiana University-Purdue University, Wood moved to Japan in the late 2000s, discovered Bitcoin in 2013, and founded the Kansai Bitcoin Meet-Up in Osaka. He joined the Ethereum team as an executive assistant, hit it off with Hoskinson, and when Hoskinson left Ethereum in 2014, Wood came with him.

Together they co-founded IOHK, with Wood serving as Chief Strategy Officer. While Hoskinson did the talking, Wood did the connecting — forging the university research partnerships with Edinburgh and Tokyo Tech that became Cardano's intellectual backbone. Despite having no formal technical background, the man helped birth two of the most consequential blockchain projects in history. He stepped down from IOG in 2020 and effectively vanished from the crypto scene. Wherever he is, he probably does not miss the drama.

## 6. Ben Goertzel — The AI Visionary

**Role**: CEO, [SingularityNET](https://singularitynet.io/) / [Artificial Superintelligence Alliance](https://superintelligence.io/) | **X**: [@bengoertzel](https://x.com/bengoertzel)

You know the humanoid robot Sophia? The one that made the rounds on every talk show for a few years? Ben Goertzel is the AI researcher behind her. The cognitive scientist and CEO of SingularityNET has been one of Cardano's highest-profile allies, praising the protocol's "low cost, high speed, top security and mathematical elegance."

In 2024, SingularityNET [merged with Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol](https://superintelligence.io/) to form the Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) Alliance — yes, the name is exactly that ambitious. The ASI token was deployed on Cardano in September 2024, replacing the old AGIX token and running on Plutus Core. Having the guy building artificial superintelligence choose your blockchain as a home base is the kind of endorsement money cannot buy.

## 7. Eran Barak — The Privacy Chief

**Role**: CEO, [Midnight](https://midnight.network/) | **LinkedIn**: [eran-barak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eran-barak/)

Eran Barak runs Midnight, Cardano's privacy-focused partner chain — the one Charles Hoskinson has described as built for a "$100 trillion market opportunity" in tokenised securities. Before joining the Cardano orbit, Barak served as COO at Symphony (one of the most secure financial services platforms in the world) and helped establish FINOS, the Fintech Open Source Foundation. Midnight uses zero-knowledge cryptography to enable trustless data protection that still meets compliance requirements. Mainnet is targeted for 2026, and if it delivers on even half its promise, Barak might be the most important name on this list in a few years.

## 8. Tim Harrison — The Bridge Builder

**Role**: VP of Community & Ecosystem, [IOG](https://iog.io/) | **LinkedIn**: [timbharrison](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timbharrison)

Every large organisation needs someone who can translate between the engineers who build things and the community who uses them. For IOG, that person is Tim Harrison. As VP of Community and Ecosystem, Harrison has been the key interface between IOG's development teams and the Cardano community for years. He played a central role in communicating the historic 2025 transition of core development funding to community governance — the first time the Cardano community directly authorised development funding through on-chain voting. Not a flashy role, but an essential one. Someone has to explain what the cryptographers are up to.

## 9. Andrew Westberg — The Swiss Army Knife

**Role**: Former CTO, [NEWM](https://newm.io/) / Co-founder, [DripDropz](https://dripdropz.io/) / Creator of [CNCLI](https://github.com/cardano-community/cncli) | **X**: [@amw7](https://x.com/amw7) | **GitHub**: [AndrewWestberg](https://github.com/AndrewWestberg) | **Stake Pool**: [BCSH] Blue Cheese Stakehouse

If there were a "most likely to have built something you use every day" award in Cardano, Andrew Westberg would win it in a landslide. A software developer with over 20 years of Linux server experience, Westberg created [CNCLI](https://github.com/cardano-community/cncli) (Cardano Node CLI) — the Rust-based tool that the majority of stake pool operators rely on daily for leader schedules, block validation, and node communication. He also built JorManager during the Jörmungandr era and the Kogmios library. The man has more open-source Cardano tools to his name than most teams.

As CTO of [NEWM](https://newm.io/), Westberg led a team building one of Cardano's most innovative applications — a music platform that tokenised streaming royalty rights, letting artists monetise their work directly and fans own fractional shares of music. Under his technical leadership, NEWM delivered the [Record Store](https://recordstore.newm.io/) marketplace, NEWM Studio, and its own Distribution Service Provider. Sadly, in February 2026 NEWM [began winding down operations](https://newm.io/sunset/), halting music distribution and setting a final platform shutdown for June 30, 2026 — the result of unfavourable market conditions and insufficient funding to scale a project of its ambition. It is a genuine loss — we at Sandstone were following NEWM from the very beginning, and the work they did in tokenising music rights on Cardano was truly groundbreaking. The team has pledged to open-source their technical infrastructure, including their smart contracts for royalty distribution, so their innovations will live on even if the company does not.

Westberg also co-founded DripDropz with Kyle Solomon and runs the Blue Cheese Stakehouse [BCSH] pool. Few people in the Cardano ecosystem have built essential infrastructure across as many layers of the stack — from low-level SPO tooling to DeFi infrastructure to music industry innovation. Westberg is the rare builder who makes everyone else's work possible, and wherever he turns his attention next, the ecosystem will be better for it.

## 10. Sebastien Guillemot — The Multi-Chain Maestro

**Role**: CTO & Co-founder, [dcSpark](https://dcspark.io/) | **X**: [@SebastienGllmt](https://x.com/SebastienGllmt) | **GitHub**: [SebastienGllmt](https://github.com/SebastienGllmt)

Before Sebastien Guillemot co-founded dcSpark, he was VP of Engineering at EMURGO, where he led development of the Yoroi wallet — an experience that presumably taught him everything about what Cardano's tooling ecosystem needed (and what it was missing). In April 2021, he teamed up with Nicolas Arqueros and Robert Kornacki to launch dcSpark, whose flagship product Milkomeda brought EVM compatibility to Cardano through a sidechain.

Charles Hoskinson called Milkomeda's launch "a great moment for Cardano," which, coming from a man not known for freely distributing praise, says something. Guillemot is also co-founder of Paima Studios (on-chain gaming) and has contributed to more open-source Cardano libraries than you can reasonably keep track of. If you have ever wondered who builds the tools that builders use, it is people like Guillemot.

## 11. Pi Lanningham — The Mathematician Turned DeFi Pioneer

**Role**: CTO, [Sundae Labs](https://sundae.fi/) | **X**: [@Quantumplation](https://x.com/Quantumplation) | **GitHub**: [Quantumplation](https://github.com/Quantumplation) | **Stake Pool**: [314] 314 Pool

Named after a mathematical constant and known online as Quantumplation, Pi Lanningham was practically destined for a career that merges mathematics and technology. As CTO of Sundae Labs, he built [SundaeSwap](https://sundae.fi/) — the first AMM-based decentralised exchange on Cardano. If you were around for its launch day, you remember the excitement (and the congestion).

More recently, Sundae Labs has been collaborating directly with IOG and Well-Typed on [Ouroboros Leios](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-leios-design-goals-and-concepts/) — a proposed consensus upgrade targeting dramatically increased throughput. That is a long way from building a DEX: Lanningham has gone from DeFi application layer to helping redesign the consensus mechanism itself. His [314] stake pool name is a nice touch.

## 12. Philip DiSarro — The Formal Verification Evangelist

**Role**: Founder & CEO, [Anastasia Labs](https://anastasialabs.com/) | **X**: [@phil_uplc](https://x.com/phil_uplc) | **GitHub**: [Anastasia-Labs](https://github.com/Anastasia-Labs)

Philip DiSarro was a FinTech software engineer at Plaid before deciding that what the blockchain world really needed was more formal verification. With a background in compiler development and programming language theory, he became one of the first developers to formally verify smart contracts on Cardano using Agda. He then went and founded Anastasia Labs, which has since produced the [Design Patterns](https://github.com/Anastasia-Labs/design-patterns) repository, the [Lucid Evolution](https://github.com/Anastasia-Labs/lucid-evolution) transaction builder, and [Midgard](https://github.com/Anastasia-Labs/midgard) — Cardano's first permissionless Layer-2 protocol.

Oh, and he served as Lead Smart Contract Developer at WingRiders, consults for EMURGO, and lectures on the side. For someone building a Layer-2 scaling solution, he certainly does not seem to have a scaling problem when it comes to his own workload.

## 13. Matthias Benkort (KtorZ) — The Language Designer

**Role**: Co-creator of [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org/) | **X**: [@KtorZ_](https://x.com/KtorZ_) | **GitHub**: [KtorZ](https://github.com/KtorZ)

If you are building smart contracts on Cardano in 2026 and you are not using Aiken, someone in your Discord is probably telling you to switch. Matthias Benkort — known to the community as KtorZ — co-created the language alongside Lucas Rosa and Kasey White, and it has fundamentally changed how developers build on Cardano. Within a year of its release, most major DeFi protocols had adopted or begun migrating to it.

A former IOG engineer, Benkort is widely regarded as one of the developers quietly carrying the ecosystem forward. The Cardano Foundation actively collaborates with him and the Aiken team to expand the toolchain. Benkort is the kind of person whose GitHub contribution graph probably looks like a solid green wall.

## 14. Lars Brünjes — The Professor

**Role**: Education Director, [IOG](https://iog.io/) / CTO, [Genius Yield](https://www.geniusyield.co/) | **GitHub**: [brunjlar](https://github.com/brunjlar)

Dr. Lars Brünjes holds a PhD in pure mathematics and serves as IOG's Director of Education — which means he is the person responsible for teaching thousands of developers Haskell and Plutus through the Plutus Pioneer Program. If you have ever completed one of those courses, you have Lars to thank (or blame, depending on how you feel about monads).

He co-authored "Plutus: Writing reliable smart contracts" with Polina Vinogradova and has led developer training initiatives across Africa. He also serves as CTO of Genius Yield, because apparently running one of the most important developer education programs in blockchain was not keeping him busy enough.

## 15. Duncan Coutts — The Haskell Veteran

**Role**: Architecture Lead, [IOG](https://iog.io/)

Duncan Coutts has been writing Haskell for over 35 years — which, for context, is longer than most blockchain developers have been alive. As IOG's architectural lead, his decisions underpin the Cardano node implementation, the networking layer, and the overall systems design. He is the person who has to translate IOG's formal specifications into software that actually runs in production.

If that sounds unglamorous compared to designing consensus protocols, consider this: without Coutts and engineers like him, all those beautifully peer-reviewed papers would just be PDFs. He designed the node as modular, composable components that can evolve through hard forks without breaking existing functionality — which is why Cardano can upgrade itself without the drama that typically accompanies other blockchain forks.

## 16. Marek Mahut — The First of Everything

**Role**: CEO, [Five Binaries](https://fivebinaries.com/) / Creator of [Blockfrost](https://blockfrost.io/) | **X**: [@stakenuts](https://x.com/stakenuts) | **GitHub**: [mmahut](https://github.com/mmahut) | **Stake Pool**: [NUTS] StakeNuts

Marek Mahut collects Cardano firsts the way others collect badges. First stake pool on the Shelley Incentivized Testnet. First smart contract on Cardano. First Cardano NFT. If there was a "first" to claim, Mahut was probably already there, coffee in hand, waiting for the chain to go live.

As CEO of Five Binaries, he built Blockfrost — the API infrastructure that most Cardano developers use to interact with the blockchain. It became so essential that IOG made a strategic investment in it in 2024. He also runs the StakeNuts [NUTS] pool and works with the NFT Guild on community standards. If Cardano had a hall of fame, Mahut would be in the inaugural class on the first ballot.

## 17. John O'Connor — The Africa Pioneer

**Role**: Director of African Operations, [IOG](https://iog.io/)

John O'Connor is the person who turned Cardano's "blockchain for the developing world" mission from a whitepaper talking point into an actual deployment. Half-Ethiopian himself, O'Connor led the [2021 partnership with Ethiopia's Ministry of Education](https://iog.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/27/blockchain-finally-comes-of-age-with-worlds-biggest-blockchain-deployment/) to implement a blockchain-based digital identity system for five million students and 750,000 teachers across more than 3,000 schools — the largest blockchain deployment in Africa.

While many blockchain projects talk about real-world impact, O'Connor went out and built it. His work across IOG's focus countries represents the clearest expression of Cardano's founding vision, and the kind of thing that is easy to overlook when everyone is arguing about DeFi yields and governance votes.

## 18. Dewayne Cameron — The Lending Protocol Pioneer

**Role**: Co-founder & CEO, [Liqwid Labs](https://liqwid.finance/) | **LinkedIn**: [dewayne-cameron](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dewayne-cameron-698177145/)

Dewayne Cameron studied psychology at the College of the Holy Cross and finance at Durham University Business School — a combination that turns out to be surprisingly useful for building DeFi lending protocols on a blockchain that everybody told him was "too slow for DeFi." Cameron co-founded Liqwid Labs in September 2020 and spent 2.5 years of engineering work before the v1 mainnet launch in February 2023. Liqwid Finance became the first pooled lending protocol on Cardano mainnet.

The team also contributed the Agora governance protocol, which has been adopted by SundaeSwap, Summon, and Clarity — proving that building on Cardano is not just about your own protocol, but about lifting the boats around you.

## 19. Lucas Rosa — The Compiler Whisperer

**Role**: Project Lead, [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org/) / Senior Engineer, [TxPipe](https://txpipe.io/) | **GitHub**: [rvcas](https://github.com/rvcas)

Lucas Rosa is the project lead for Aiken and a senior engineer at TxPipe. With a background in compiler development — he previously spent over a year building Roc, a new functional programming language — Rosa is the kind of developer who builds programming languages before breakfast and then uses them to build more things after lunch. His work on Aiken alongside Matthias Benkort and Kasey White has been recognised by the Cardano Foundation as representing the future of smart contract development on Cardano.

## 20. Santiago Carmuega — The Plumber

**Role**: Founder, [TxPipe](https://txpipe.io/) / Creator of [Oura](https://github.com/txpipe/oura) | **GitHub**: [scarmuega](https://github.com/scarmuega)

"The Plumber" is meant as the highest compliment. Santiago Carmuega is a senior developer with over 20 years of experience who founded TxPipe to build the open-source infrastructure that everyone needs but nobody wants to fundraise for. His flagship tool, Oura, is a Rust-native pipeline that connects to Cardano nodes, filters blockchain events, and routes them wherever you need — and it runs on a Raspberry Pi.

He has also built Dolos (a lightweight data node), Mumak (a PostgreSQL extension), and Tx3, a domain-specific language for Cardano transactions. Carmuega is the person who builds the pipes so everyone else can focus on what flows through them.

## 21. Nicolas Arqueros — The Operator

**Role**: CEO & Co-founder, [dcSpark](https://dcspark.io/)

Every high-output engineering firm needs someone whose job is to make sure brilliant people can actually ship things — managing the budget, the contracts, the strategy, and the inevitable chaos that accompanies building at the frontier. For dcSpark, that is Nicolas Arqueros. A former EMURGO team member who co-founded dcSpark in April 2021, Arqueros has quietly built one of the most respected development firms in the Cardano space. While Guillemot ships code and Kornacki explores new chains, Arqueros keeps the whole operation pointed in the right direction. The output — Milkomeda, Flint Wallet, Paima Studios, a catalogue of open-source tooling — is the testament.

## 22. Robert Kornacki — The Chain Hopper

**Role**: Co-founder, [dcSpark](https://dcspark.io/) / Founder, SYRE

Robert Kornacki was one of the first Cardano Fellows in the dLab/EMURGO accelerator — essentially Cardano's original startup incubator — and has spent the years since making blockchains talk to each other. Before co-founding dcSpark, he built SYRE, a tool designed to help users send funds to the correct wallet address (a problem that, frankly, haunts all of crypto). His instinct for interoperability has been central to dcSpark's cross-chain work, and his willingness to go wherever the interesting problems are — whether that is Cardano, Algorand, or somewhere else entirely — makes him one of the more restless builders in the ecosystem. That restlessness tends to produce things worth paying attention to.

## 23. Lloyd Duhon — The Governance Workhorse

**Role**: Chair, Community Advisory Board, [Intersect](https://www.intersectmbo.org/) / COO, [DripDropz](https://dripdropz.io/) / Host, Cardano Over Coffee | **Website**: [lloydduhon.com](https://www.lloydduhon.com/)

A U.S. Army veteran with over 25 years of IT experience, Lloyd Duhon might be the hardest-working person in Cardano governance. As Chair of Intersect's Community Advisory Board, he sits on the Civics Working Group and Governance Parameter Working Group. He organised the [Chicago CIP-1694 Workshop](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/cip-1694-community-workshops-part-of-our-global-campaign). He organised the Indianapolis DRep Code of Conduct Workshop. He co-authored "The Guidebook to Cardano Governance." He hosts Cardano Over Coffee — a daily X Spaces show. He serves as COO at DripDropz. If you are wondering when the man sleeps, so are we.

## 24. Rick McCracken — The Veteran SPO

**Role**: SPO, [DIGI Stake Pool](https://digitalfortress.online/) | **X**: [@RichardMcCrackn](https://x.com/RichardMcCrackn)

Rick McCracken has been running the DIGI stake pool since 2019 — which in Cardano years makes him practically ancient. But his influence extends well beyond pool operations. McCracken is one of the most active voices in governance discussions, consistently showing up in debates about Mithril signing adoption, protocol parameter governance, and ecosystem security. He represents the SPO archetype: someone who sees block production not as a passive income stream, but as an active responsibility to steward the network.

## 25. Peter Bui — The Educator Down Under

**Role**: Host, [Learn Cardano Podcast](https://learncardano.io/) / Cardano Ambassador & DRep | **GitHub**: [Peter-Bui](https://github.com/Peter-Bui) | **Website**: [learncardano.io](https://learncardano.io)

Based on the Gold Coast, Australia, Peter Bui has been creating Cardano educational content since 2017 — back when explaining "proof-of-stake" to someone usually resulted in blank stares. His Learn Cardano Podcast has accumulated over 2 million YouTube views covering staking, smart contracts, Catalyst, and governance. He runs a stake pool, serves as a Cardano Ambassador, was spotlighted by the Cardano Foundation in January 2026, and is an active DRep.

If Cardano had a "most patient explainer" award, Bui would be a perennial nominee.

## 26. Cardano Whale — The Rebel DRep

**Role**: Anonymous DRep | **X**: [@cardano_whale](https://x.com/cardano_whale)

Every good drama needs an antagonist, and in 2025, the anonymous entity known as "Cardano Whale" stepped into the role with gusto. Controlling approximately 6 million ADA in delegated voting power, Whale publicly declared a [blanket rejection of all future IOG proposals](https://coinedition.com/cardano-governance-crisis-charles-hoskinson-drep-whale/), accusing the organisation of wasting funds without results. The ultimatum: delegate to representatives committed to auto-denying IOG proposals.

Hoskinson [responded](https://coinedition.com/cardano-governance-crisis-charles-hoskinson-drep-whale/) by calling the opposition "emotionally charged" and revealing legal consultations regarding potential defamation. The community split down the middle. Some cheered the accountability. Others pointed out that blanket opposition is not exactly nuanced governance. Either way, Cardano Whale stress-tested the DRep system in a way no simulation ever could — proving that concentrated voting power creates real political dynamics, for better or worse.

## 27. Hosky — The Mascot (Literally)

**Role**: Creator, [Hosky Token](https://hosky.io/) / Anonymous SPO Advocate | **Website**: [hosky.io](https://hosky.io/)

Where to begin. Hosky is the pseudonymous creator of the HOSKY token — Cardano's first and most iconic meme coin — who appears in public exclusively wearing a full-size plush dog costume. The token launched with 50% of its one-quadrillion supply sent directly to "The Master" (Hoskinson himself), which is either the greatest joke in crypto or the most audacious marketing stunt, depending on your perspective. Probably both.

But here is the twist: beneath the absurdist exterior lies a genuine contribution. Hosky's "Rug Pool" programme uses the token's popularity to support independent stake pool operators — delegators earn normal staking rewards plus free HOSKY every epoch. It is one of the most creative approaches to fighting stake pool centralisation in any proof-of-stake network. The fact that this serious infrastructure contribution comes wrapped in a dog suit perfectly captures the spirit of the Cardano community.

## 28. Big Pey — The OG Content Creator

**Role**: Host, [The Cardano Aura](https://creators.spotify.com/pod/show/bigpeyyt) / Operator, [Bloom Pool](https://bloompool.io/) | **X**: [@bigpeyYT](https://x.com/bigpeyYT)

Big Pey's Bloom Pool minted the 8th block on the Cardano mainnet, which is the blockchain equivalent of being at Woodstock — except with better uptime. One of the ecosystem's most recognisable content creators, Big Pey interviews ecosystem leaders, breaks down trending topics, and is not afraid to ruffle feathers when the situation calls for it.

Case in point: Big Pey was the community member who [shared the anonymous whistleblower email](https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-hoskinson-whistleblower-allegations/) about the Cardano Foundation in late 2024, bringing uncomfortable but important allegations into the public eye. In an ecosystem that sometimes struggles with transparency, that kind of willingness to surface difficult conversations matters.

## 29. YUTA (Yuki Oishi) — The Tokyo Delegate

**Role**: Cardano Ambassador / DRep / Operator, ZZZ Pool | **X**: [@yuta_cryptox](https://x.com/yuta_cryptox)

Yuki Oishi, known as YUTA, is a long-time Cardano Ambassador based in Tokyo who has built critical bridges between the Japanese-speaking community and Cardano's global governance. He operates the ZZZ stake pool (ironic name for someone who never seems to rest) and served on the Interim Constitutional Committee representing the Eastern Cardano Council.

YUTA has maintained a 100% voting participation record since registering as a DRep, consistently publishing detailed rationales for every vote. In a governance system where voter apathy is a real concern, his track record sets a standard the rest of the DRep community should aspire to.

## 30. Adam Dean — The Bug Hunter

**Role**: Governance Developer, [DripDropz](https://dripdropz.io/) / Community Developer & Tester

Adam Dean earned ecosystem-wide recognition the hard way: by finding critical bugs during the Vasil hard fork preparation in 2022. When he [identified issues in Cardano node version 1.35.2](https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-vasil-hard-fork-delayed-new-critical-bug) that caused the testnet to collapse, Dean went public — a move that was equal parts brave and necessary. The incident demonstrated that Cardano's quality assurance does not just come from IOG's internal teams; it comes from community developers who care enough to break things before mainnet does.

Dean joined the DripDropz team as a governance developer and co-authored "The Guidebook to Cardano Governance." From bug hunter to governance architect — not a bad career arc.

## 31. Mercy Fordwoo — The Africa Connector

**Role**: Co-founder & Partnerships Lead, [Wada](https://wada.org/)

Mercy Fordwoo has over 25 years of experience in project management and community engagement spanning West Africa, the UK, and Canada — and she has channelled all of it into growing the Cardano community across Africa and the diaspora through Wada Global. In the ecosystem since 2017, Fordwoo helped draft the [interim Cardano Constitution](https://constitution.gov.tools/en), served on the outgoing Interim Constitutional Committee, and organised the [Cardano Africa Tech Summit (CATS)](https://summit.cardano.org/).

While many talk about "bringing blockchain to Africa," Fordwoo has been doing it — on the ground, in communities, for years.

## 32. Darlington Wleh — The Nairobi Builder

**Role**: Co-founder, [Lido Nation](https://www.lidonation.com/) / President, Blockchain Centre Nairobi | **GitHub**: [DarlingtonWleh](https://github.com/DarlingtonWleh)

Born in Liberia, Darlington Wleh is a software and DevOps engineer who co-founded Lido Nation alongside Stephanie King. The platform was named an [official media partner of Cardano Summit 2025](https://summit.cardano.org/) in Berlin. Wleh also serves as President of the Blockchain Centre Nairobi and works with the DripDropz team. His Ngong Road Blockchain Lab in Kenya connects Cardano's technology with real-world community needs — the kind of boots-on-the-ground work that does not generate Twitter hype but builds lasting impact.

## 33. Stephanie King — The Teacher

**Role**: Co-founder, [Lido Nation](https://www.lidonation.com/)

Stephanie King is a teacher and technologist who co-founded Lido Nation with Darlington Wleh, and the educator's instinct shows in everything the platform produces. Lido Nation has grown into a comprehensive resource covering Cardano news, governance, and educational content in multiple languages. Their Catalyst proposal explorer has become one of the most-used community tools for navigating Project Catalyst — which, if you have ever tried to navigate Catalyst's interface without help, you know is a genuine public service.

## 34. Jaromir Tesar — The Czech Chronicler

**Role**: Founder, [Cardanians.io](https://cardanians.io/) / Cardano Ambassador | **X**: [@JaromirTesar](https://x.com/JaromirTesar) | **Medium**: [Cardanians.io](https://cardanians-io.medium.com/) | **Stake Pool**: [CRDNS]

Jaromir Tesar founded Cardanians.io — one of the longest-running Cardano educational platforms — and has been writing about Cardano technology with metronomic consistency ever since. Working alongside Lukas Barta, Tesar has published hundreds of in-depth articles and was involved in developing Adapools.org, a widely used stake pool analytics platform. The Czech Cardano community he has helped build is frequently cited as one of the strongest regional communities in the world. Proof that you do not need a VC fund to build influence — just a keyboard and persistence.

## 35. Cardano with Paul — The YouTube Professor

**Role**: YouTuber & SPO, [cardanowithpaul.com](https://www.cardanowithpaul.com/) | **X**: [@tradingwithpaul](https://x.com/tradingwithpaul) | **Stake Pools**: [PAUL] / [PAUL1]

With over 61,000 subscribers and 3.8 million total views across 515+ videos, Cardano with Paul is one of the most prolific Cardano content channels on YouTube. Paul runs two stake pools on Azure Kubernetes clusters — which is either impressively over-engineered or exactly the right amount of engineered, depending on who you ask. His content ranges from beginner staking guides to deep DeFi dives, delivered with the steady cadence of someone who has been explaining things to the internet for a very long time.

## 36. Army of Spies — The Anonymous Analysts

**Role**: Content Creators & SPO | **X**: [@ArmySpies](https://x.com/ArmySpies) | **YouTube**: Army of Spies

Army of Spies is a trio of self-described "citizens of the world who value anonymity" — three people producing Cardano content since 2021. What started as a dApp proposal in Catalyst Fund 3 evolved into a YouTube channel and the AOS stake pool (operational since February 2022). Their videos prioritise deliberative analysis over hype, which makes them something of a palate cleanser in a space that occasionally runs on pure adrenaline. If you want the sober take, these are your people.

## 37. Kenric Nelson — The Voting Scientist

**Role**: President & Founder, [Photrek](https://photrek.io/) | **LinkedIn**: [kenric-nelson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenric-nelson-ph-d-7495b77)

Dr. Kenric Nelson runs Photrek, an institutional member of Intersect that has done pioneering research on community decision-making — including alternative voting methods for IOG, the Sociocratic DRep model, and an AI assistant for DRep governance. If that sounds niche, consider that the question "how do millions of token holders make collective decisions without it devolving into chaos?" is arguably the central challenge of decentralised governance. Nelson is one of the few people applying rigorous academic methods to answer it.

## 38. Kyle Solomon — The Token Distribution King

**Role**: CEO & Co-founder, [DripDropz](https://dripdropz.io/) / DRep

Kyle Solomon co-founded DripDropz alongside Andrew Westberg, building what became Cardano's go-to token distribution platform. Under his leadership, DripDropz expanded into open-source voting infrastructure and the Cardano Mainstreet Suite. Solomon was selected as one of seven Developer and Builder DReps to receive delegation from the Cardano Foundation — an endorsement that recognises both his building contributions and his governance participation.

## 39. Chris Gianelloni — The Infrastructure Engineer

**Role**: Engineer, [CloudStruct](https://cloudstruct.com/) / DRep | **GitHub**: [wolf31o2](https://github.com/wolf31o2)

Chris Gianelloni is a CloudStruct engineer providing code review, infrastructure development, and technical support for Cardano projects. Selected as one of seven Developer and Builder DReps to receive Cardano Foundation delegation, Gianelloni represents the class of builders who contribute through pull requests and infrastructure work rather than Twitter threads. The blockchain needs both, but the former tends to get a lot less recognition.

## 40. Latheesan Kanesamoorthy — The Standards Setter

**Role**: CTO, [DripDropz](https://dripdropz.io/) | **GitHub**: [latheesan-k](https://github.com/latheesan-k)

Latheesan Kanesamoorthy serves as CTO of DripDropz, but his lasting contribution to the ecosystem might be the CIP-0027 royalty standard he co-authored. Before joining DripDropz, he built Tokhun's NFT minting and trading solution — and the royalty standard he helped create now governs how NFT royalties work across the entire Cardano ecosystem. It is a perfect example of how one developer's side project can become an industry-wide convention.

## 41. Polina Vinogradova — The Formal Methods Guardian

**Role**: Formal Methods Researcher, [IOG](https://iog.io/)

Polina Vinogradova has been at IOG since 2018, applying mathematical verification to ensure the correctness of Cardano's ledger implementation. She co-authored "Plutus: Writing reliable smart contracts" with Lars Brünjes and contributed to published research on formal ledger models. In 2019, she co-instructed IOG's Haskell training course in Ethiopia. Her work is the kind that most users will never directly interact with — and that is exactly the point. When the math is right, you do not notice it. You only notice when it is wrong.

## 42. Florian Volery — The Swiss Banker in DeFi

**Role**: Co-founder, [Liqwid Labs](https://liqwid.finance/) | **LinkedIn**: [florian-volery](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-volery/)

Florian Volery brings over a decade of Swiss banking experience to his role as co-founder of Liqwid Finance — which is about as perfectly on-brand as you can get for a DeFi lending protocol. Based in Zürich, Volery designed the CASL ETP (Cardano Staking ETP), listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange, which captures ADA's price performance while generating staking returns. If DeFi's long-term future involves bridging traditional finance and decentralised protocols, Volery is already building that bridge from the Swiss end.

## 43. Razali Samsudin — The Sustainability Advocate

**Role**: Founder, [Sustainable ADA](https://sustainableada.com/) & [Impact Web3](https://impactweb3.org/) | **LinkedIn**: [razali-samsudin](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/razali-samsudin)

In an industry that sometimes struggles to articulate its real-world value proposition, Razali Samsudin has spent over four years connecting blockchain technology to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Through Sustainable ADA and Impact Web3, he has implemented multiple Catalyst-funded projects, presented at the Blockchain4Good Summit 2025, and published the Cardano Impact Report. His work is a persistent reminder that blockchains can serve purposes beyond financial speculation — even if the market does not always seem to notice.

## 44. Phillip Pon — The New Guard

**Role**: CEO, [EMURGO](https://emurgo.io/)

Phillip Pon took over as EMURGO's CEO in April 2025, succeeding founder Ken Kodama — inheriting the commercial engine of a blockchain that has been building for nearly a decade. His mandate: scale Cardano's commercial adoption globally and prove that EMURGO can thrive beyond its founding generation. The shoes are large. Early signs suggest he is not intimidated by that.

## 45. Kasey White — The Third Musketeer

**Role**: Co-creator, [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org/)

Every great trio has a member who keeps a lower profile — and for Aiken, that is Kasey White. Alongside Matthias Benkort and Lucas Rosa, White co-created the language from the ground up, shaping the compiler architecture and toolchain that developers now rely on daily. Aiken's rapid adoption — most major Cardano DeFi protocols migrated to it within a year of launch — is as much a testament to its solid engineering foundations as to its elegance, and those foundations are partly White's work. Not everyone needs a public profile for their contributions to matter. Some people just build things that work.

## 46. Lukas Barta — The Other Half of Cardanians

**Role**: Cardano Ambassador / Co-operator, [Cardanians.io](https://cardanians.io/) | **Stake Pool**: [CRDNS]

Lukas Barta works alongside Jaromir Tesar as the other half of the Cardanians operation — co-operating the platform, the CRDNS stake pool, and maintaining Adapools.org. Together, they have built one of the most prolific educational operations in the ecosystem. The Czech Cardano community they have cultivated punches well above its weight, proving that sustained, consistent effort builds more than any amount of marketing spend.

## 47. John Woods — The One That Got Away

**Role**: Former Director of Cardano Architecture, IOG

John Woods served as Director of Cardano Architecture at IOG before departing to become CTO of the Algorand Foundation. His career trajectory is both a compliment and a cautionary tale: Cardano's rigorous engineering culture produces professionals sought after across the entire blockchain industry — which is great for the industry and less great for IOG's retention numbers. A loss for Cardano, certainly, but a testament to the calibre of talent the ecosystem has cultivated.

## 48. Rio "Popeye" Inaba — The Operations Chief

**Role**: Group COO, [EMURGO](https://emurgo.io/)

Rio "Popeye" Inaba was named Group COO of EMURGO in 2022 as part of its 3.0 restructuring — an overhaul designed to evolve EMURGO from a startup into a global enterprise. The nickname alone earns him a mention, but the substance backs it up. Under his operational leadership, EMURGO has expanded from its Japanese roots into a truly international organisation managing operations across Asia, Africa, and the Americas, with offices, academies, and partnerships spanning multiple continents. Building a coherent global operation on top of a decentralised protocol — with all the regulatory, cultural, and logistical complexity that implies — is not a role for the faint-hearted. Popeye seems to manage it without breaking a sweat.

## 49. Cardano Foundation Whistleblower — The Anonymous Voice

**Role**: Anonymous Community Member

In late 2024, a mystery guest arrived in Cardano's governance drama — an anonymous whistleblower whose email made its way to Big Pey and then to the entire community. The accusations were pointed: the Foundation tried to poach IOG engineers, used its 180 million ADA voting bloc to dominate Catalyst Fund 13, pushed for Dubai as the Summit venue against the community's wishes, and dragged its feet on supporting Intersect's formation.

Hoskinson described it as "extraordinarily frustrating." The Foundation clarified its positions. X was briefly on fire. And when the smoke cleared, the conversation it ignited about institutional transparency and multi-stakeholder governance turned out to be one of the most important the ecosystem had in 2024. Whoever was behind the email understood something essential: in a decentralised system, accountability sometimes requires an anonymous hand to pull the curtain back. We may never know who it was. But we know what changed because of it.

## 50. Hosky's Rug Pool SPOs — The Unsung Backbone

**Role**: Independent Stake Pool Operators supported by the Hosky Rug Pool Programme

We are ending this list not with an individual, but with a collective — the independent stake pool operators supported through Hosky's Rug Pool programme. These are the small, often one-person operations running Cardano nodes from home servers and cloud infrastructure around the world. They are validated by the community, incentivised through Hosky's creative mechanism, and they represent something no foundation, corporation, or protocol upgrade can manufacture: genuine grassroots decentralisation.

Every five days, these operators and their delegators prove that Cardano's vision of a truly decentralised network is not theoretical. It is operational. And it is running on someone's server in their spare room.

## The Ones We Lost

No who's who of the Cardano community would be complete without honouring the people who helped build it but are no longer with us. Cardano has a tradition — one that speaks volumes about its culture — of naming hard forks after community members who have passed away.

**[Vasil St. Dabov](https://cardanofeed.com/cardano-s-next-release-is-vasil-but-who-is-vasil-st-dabov-114736.html)** was a Bulgarian mathematician, environmentalist, entrepreneur, and Cardano Ambassador who passed away on December 5, 2021. A Haskell enthusiast who planted over 10,000 trees, Dabov saw deep parallels between Cardano and ginkgo trees — both built for longevity and resilience. The [Vasil hard fork](https://www.cardanofoundation.org/blog/the-vasil-hard-fork-a-new-update-to-scale-and-optimize-the-cardano) in September 2022, the most extensive network upgrade attempted at the time, was named in his honour. His family continues to operate the VASIL stake pool, carrying on his work.

**[Phil Chang](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2024/08/30/chang-upgrade-a-big-step-in-changing-the-world-with-cardano/)** was an IOG team member whose contributions to Cardano's governance strategy and the Voltaire concept were foundational. He passed away in 2022, and the [Chang hard fork](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/chang-upgrade-1-hard-fork-achieved) — which launched on September 1, 2024 and ushered Cardano into the era of on-chain governance — was named after him. It is fitting that the upgrade which gave the community its voice carries the name of someone who helped design the system that made it possible.

**[Matthew Plomin](https://www.emurgo.io/press-news/explainer-the-plomin-hard-fork-cardano/)** was the co-founder of W3i and a driving force behind the USDM stablecoin on Cardano. He passed away unexpectedly in November 2024. The upgrade originally designated "Chang #2" was [renamed the Plomin hard fork](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/plomin-hard-fork-ratified) in his honour, going live on January 29, 2025, and completing the governance framework that gave ADA holders full voting rights on protocol changes.

**[Max van Rossem](https://blockonomi.com/cardano-to-honor-drep-max-van-rossem-with-proposed-2026-hard-fork-name/)** was a DRep who co-led the Constitutional Committee Election Working Group, helped author Article VIII of the Cardano Constitution, and founded AdaMoments — a project letting ADA holders store personal memories permanently on-chain. He [passed away peacefully in his sleep](https://x.com/IntersectMBO/status/1978098176990085595) from heart failure while in Japan. The community [voted to name the upcoming Protocol Version 11 hard fork](https://coinedition.com/cardano-opens-vote-to-name-2026-hard-fork-after-drep-max-van-rossem/) the "van Rossem" hard fork in his honour.

In most industries, you name things after founders and billionaires. In Cardano, you name your most important upgrades after the community members who gave their time, energy, and passion to the ecosystem. That says something about what kind of community this is.

---

## The Bigger Picture

Fifty profiles down, and we have barely scratched the surface. Behind these names are thousands more stake pool operators, developers, Catalyst proposers, DReps, and community members whose contributions rarely make headlines but collectively determine where this thing goes next.

What makes the Cardano community genuinely different is not its size — it is its structure. The ecosystem has built real institutions: Intersect, the DRep system, Project Catalyst, the Constitutional Committee. These give people actual pathways to shape the protocol. And as this post shows, that infrastructure gets tested in real time. Budget disputes between founding entities. DRep revolts against core developers. Anonymous whistleblowers. A person in a dog costume advocating for stake pool decentralisation. If this were a television series, you would say the writers were being too ambitious.

But here is the thing: none of it has broken the system. The disagreements, the drama, the passionate debates — they are not signs of dysfunction. They are signs of a governance system with enough surface area for genuine conflict and enough resilience to process it. That is rare in any institution, let alone a decentralised one.

At Sandstone, we have watched this community evolve from the earliest days of staking through Alonzo, Vasil, Chang, Plomin, and now into the age of on-chain budgets and community-directed development. The people profiled here are not just building technology. They are building the social fabric that technology alone cannot provide.

The next chapter of Cardano will be written by the people who show up to write it. Based on the cast of characters we have met today, it should be a good read.

Happy staking.
